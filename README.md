## KITCEP

This toolkit is for free use of CEP data, which belong to the Brazilian citizen but CORREIOS(is a federal public company) sells for 850 reais.

And if you pay for the CEP data you end up getting the data in access and txt formats with poor documentation and basic support.

None of the CORREIOS work on this package they sell justifies the charge of __850 Brazilian REAIS__, apart from the guarantees it has due to the monopoly of the activity (which has poor execution; bad service) and the fact of ignoring requests for opening of CEP data for use by society(put it online for free), without any onus, as a bonus to endure an expensive service.

Some videos about the quality of the postal service can be seen in the links below.
